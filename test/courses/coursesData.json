Lecture material includes distance measurement, differential, profile and indirect leveling and use of transit, traversing and mapping. Errors, corrections and balancing are also discussed. The use of available software packages for the reduction and calculation of data is encouraged throughout the course. In the field, students practice the basic techniques of instrument use through various assignments. Careful and efficient handling of instruments and proper note-keeping are stressed. The use of state-of-the-art electronic surveying instruments is included in the field assignments wherever possible. The school is held on campus immediately following the final First Year examination in April.",

Students will report to a faculty supervisor from the School of Drama and Music. The practicum / research report represents the culmination of the student¿s learning to apply and integrate the knowledge garnered from the program. In addition to obtaining experiential learning within an arts organization, students will write a research project report that will include an in-depth strategic review encompassing artistic vision, audience development, revenue and business development, governance and human resources, financial analysis and the external environment. This research project report will also include recommendations that can contribute to the future success of the organization. Through their practicum, the Masters students will gain practical experience and apply their theoretical knowledge; observe and analyze problems and solutions in a professional arts setting; interact",

Quantum optics concerns the interaction of light with quantum systems, and the quantum nature of light itself. Recent years have seen a rapid growth of activity in research involving both nonlinear and quantum optics, enabled in part by new condensed matter materials (especially semiconductor nanostructures) and ultrafast laser systems. This course will introduce the basic principles of nonlinear and quantum optics and make a connection to a selection of modern research topics in these areas.",
