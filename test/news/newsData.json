He added that Police aren’t treating the case as suspicious or as a suicide.\nIt’s unknown whether Kevin had any pre-existing medical conditions.\nAfter studying at the University of Manitoba, Cournoyer transferred to Queen’s to complete his studies in electrical engineering.\nCournoyer’s grandfather encouraged him to look at universities in Ontario, his sister said.\n“He knew he could do better than U of M,” she said. “He was the smartest one in our family.”\nAfter hearing he had been accepted to Queen’s, Kevin was ecstatic, she added.\nHe was an avid outdoor enthusiast and loved to played flag football and hockey for fun, where he met many friends.\n“Kevin was always into sports and was such an easy person to talk to ... he was very personable,” she said.\nFor Stephanie, her brother will always be remembered for the jokes he pulled last Christmas.\nThe Cournoyer family went to a friend’s house for Christmas Eve, where Kevin joked that they were all misfits.\n“Usually one of us stays behind, but this year all of us went as a family ... that ride there was different for some reason,” she said.\n“He was just so funny and made us and everyone else laugh all the time.”\nThis past year was one of the best for Kevin, she said.\nShe added that she’s never seen him have more fun than at Queen’s.\n“This was probably the happiest year of his life there,” she said. “[He] made so many friends, and I remember him with his purple jacket and when he showed it and cut his hair ... it was shocking.”\nHe loved the campus life, and found a house to live in next year with friends.\n“The last time my parents Skyped with him they were just seeing him become an actual man and [become] responsible,” she said.\nFollowing Kevin’s death, his parents came to Kingston and met some of his friends. This was a comfort to them, Stephanie said.\n“It was one thing having him talk about the people he kept on meeting but actually meeting these people was very helpful for them,” she said.\nKevin’s funeral service will take place tomorrow at St. Timothy’s Catholic Church in Winnipeg.\nFamily and friends may sign a Book of Condolence at glenlawn.ca.\n— Vincent Matak \nStudents can contact Health, Counselling and Disability Services at 613-533-6000 ext. 78264",

After serving proudly as a Lieutenant with the 48th Highlander Regiment of Canada, he came to Queen’s and graduated with a BA in 1971 and an MBA in 1977. He earned his CMC accreditation in 1988.\nWhile an undergrad at Queen’s, Rob served as Speaker of the AMS ­Assembly. One of his proudest accomplishments in that capacity was the creation of the first campus pub, the House of Commons, which opened in January 1970. His was also a familiar voice as co-host, with Tim Gerrard, Sc’69, and Jack ­Henderson, Sc’78, of the weekly CFRC public affairs and commentary show “Campus Comment.” Rob remained at Queen’s between degrees, working in the newly created High School Liaison Office promoting the advantages of a Queen’s education to high school students across Canada. He also served as a Don in Leonard Hall from 1975-77 while studying for his MBA.\nRob enjoyed a diverse career in the hospitality industry, management consulting, solar energy, and publishing. He lived in Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, and Kingston. But Rob’s greatest satisfaction came from teaching in local colleges and working with the Queen’s University Alumni Association, Alumni Affairs – including a stint as Director, 1990-93 – and the Queen’s Executive MBA program. He frequently traveled from his home in Vancouver to Kingston to ­attend the convocation ceremonies of the Executive MBA students he supervised. On the day of his death, he had sat through several MBA 20-minute presentations by phone but sadly did not have the opportunity to submit marks for them.\nRob’s community involvement included the Vancouver Symphony, the Vancouver Museum, the Vancouver Planning Commission, the Fraser River Discovery Centre, Van Dusen Gardens (Vancouver), and the Canadian Power Squadron. His hobbies included yachting, motor ­cycling, music, genealogy and keeping in touch with family and lifelong friends.\nRob is survived by his longtime partner Karen Lubin, a brother, a niece, and five cousins. He will be remembered by hundreds of friends and associates in and beyond the Queen’s family.\nA Celebration of Life was held Nov. 18 at Van Dusen Gardens in Vancouver. It was attended by more than 150 family and friends, many from the Queen’s community. The ceremony was emceed by Peter Watts, Artsci’74, one of those lifelong friends.\nRob will be remembered for his energy, intense enthusiasm for life, and passion for ­education. At every Queen’s convocation, graduands promise to maintain a generous loyalty to our alma mater. Rob took that promise seriously.",

You know which ones I mean.\nRemember that case where the judge rambles on and on about a series of share transfers so complex, you start to question whether the judge herself knew what happened? Or that case that made you check the Queen’s Law website to make sure “PhD (Economics)” wasn’t a prerequisite? Anyone recall that one with so many different parties, the diagram you drew to keep track of them all looked less like something usable in an outline and more like a Jackson Pollack painting?\nWell, for those of you who enjoyed the hair-raising, page-turning, who-done-it thrills of my favourite 1L case Bauer v. Bank of Montreal, [1980] 2 SCR 102 (don’t worry Class of 2017, you’ll discover this little gem next semester), you’ll LOVE the newest humdinger out of the Ontario Court of Appeal excerpted below.\n \nKAWASAKI KISEN KARPARTS LTD v. 2012578 ONTARIO LTD.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGORGONZOLA J – The plaintiff corporation Kawasaki Kisen Karparts (“Karparts”) is a manufacturer of seals used in the automotive industry. Karparts’ position is that the contract at issue is enforceable because it was signed under seal. For perplexity, the facts of this case are reproduced ab infinitum below.\n \nFACTS\nIn 2009, Canada signed a European-Canadian Free Trade Association agreement (the “Trade Deal”). The result was a marked market increase in the price of materials, such as wax, plastic, metal, and rubber, used in seal manufacturing, which, in turn, led to higher price volatility in Karparts’ seals. Karparts was the sole provider of seals to the defendant company 2012578 Ontario Ltd (“Ontario”).\nA series of highly complex transactions ensued between Karparts and Ontario following the Trade Deal. The transactions are too numerous and, for the purposes of the issue under appeal, unnecessary to reconstruct in these reasons. Regardless, I will analyze every transaction in turn as follows… [The 106-page analysis that followed is omitted].\nIn conclusion, only one transaction is determinative of the issue on this appeal: the contract of December 21, 2009.\nOn December 21, Ontario’s director, Arthur Bailey, appeared at Karparts’ main warehouse at 46 Pratt Street in Karton, Ontario to execute the contract. The office is 16’10” long by 16’8” wide. It has two windows. There is one door, used to both enter and exit the office. Covering the walls and ceiling are framed Karparts seals, mostly for decoration purposes.\nAt this office, Bailey and Karparts’ representatives signed a contract stipulating that Ontario would use Karparts as its sole seal supplier for 7 years. No seal was placed on the document. There was no consideration for Ontario having made the promise it did. Later, a dispute arose concerning a price increase demanded by Karparts in a proposed purchase order to Ontario. The dispute led to Ontario breaking the contract terms by signing a new supply contract with a Karparts’ kompetitor [sic]. Karparts sued for specific performance.\nBecause the contract was signed without consideration, but in the presence of Karparts’ seals, the question in this appeal is whether the contract was signed under seal.\n \nANALYSIS\nIn all contracts cases, trial judges must consider whether consideration flowed between plaintiff and defendant and vice-versa, whether the consideration was considerable, and any other considerable considerations. The trial judge in this case considered all of the above. We are so happy they did.\nThis case was difficult for any judge. It took course over a 231-day trial, involved over 6,700 individual documents, included testimony from 31 expert witnesses, and resulted in the hospitalization of a court clerk from the falling of 64 bankers’ boxes of evidence during closing remarks. We find no overriding or palpable error in the trial judge’s determination of the facts.\n \nLEGAL TEST\nThe legal test can be summarized into thirty-six distinct steps, all of which are reiterated below. [The first thirty-five steps are analyzed; Justice Gorgonzola continued] The last step is the most determinative and renders the previous thirty-five superfluous: was a proper seal attached to the contract?\nPrior cases show that proper seals have included black dots, wax blobs, and even a “place seal here” sticker. In McDonalds Ltd. v. Hamburglar, [1990] 2 SCR 45, a grease stain was sufficient to enforce the promise not to steal food products from a chain of popular restaurants. The case of The Great Georgio Van Wurtzdaemiener (Re) (1902) AC 56 (Eng HL) involved a tragic, fractious, and bitterly fought contest between parents and a prominent children’s entertainer. A smiley face with the defendant’s trademark catch-line, “let’s do it for the kids, Vincenzo!” underneath was sufficient in the absence of consideration.\n \nCONCLUSION\nIn no cases presented to this court were the seals in question not attached to the contract. Although the December 21 contract was signed under seal (in fact, under more than one), no seal was attached. We therefore conclude the contract is not enforceable.\nSome say that a 231-day trial of this case was a waste of precious public resources, that Karparts had no case to begin with, and that seal law is archaic and rarely appears as a contestable issue in modern corporate law. Others say that a clarification of the law in this area was not needed. Others still question why the concept of seals is taught in law schools at all. We choose to leave the determination of these criticisms to another day.\n \nAppeal dismissed.\n \n\n \nAndrew Sapiano is in 2L and hereby acknowledges that due consideration was given and received for the publishing of this article.\nIf you have any questions or comments about this article, email us at publisher@juris-diction.ca.",

      "content": "After an inquiry into the voter eligibility of 93 ballots, TAs and TFs at Queen’s remain un-unionized after a final vote result of 398 to 359 against unionization.  \nTAs and TFs cast their ballots on Nov. 26 2008.\nIn the certification vote, 332 people voted for unionization and 378 people voted against it. Two ballots were spoiled and there were 93 segregated ballots. The voter’s list included 1,300 names.\nPublic Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) Regional Organizer Christopher Wilson said in order to determine the final outcome of the vote, the Ontario Labour Relations Board needed to make a status inquiry into the 93 segregated ballots.\nThe voter eligibility of the 93 segregated ballots was in question. A TA or TF had to be employed by Queen’s as of Nov. 20 2008 in order to participate in the certification vote.\n“PSAC and Queen’s met on December 17 at the Ontario Labour Relations Board to discuss the status of the outstanding ballots,” he said. “PSAC took the position that every ballot should be counted.”\n“Forty-seven additional ballots were counted. Of those additional ballots, 27 were for unionization and 20 were against.”\nWilson said despite a majority vote against unionization, a substantial number of TAs and TFs supported the Teaching Assistants and Fellow Associates’ (TAFA) campaign.\n“The hope and expectation of PSAC and TAFA is that the University uses these vote results to reflect upon that a substantial number of graduate students want to see change,” he said. “PSAC and TAFA were very proud of the campaign, particularly the volunteer activists. The vote was an important expression of workers’ democratic rights.”\nThis is the third failed attempt to unionize TAs and TFs at Queen’s.\nVolunteer TAFA organizer Dave Thompson, PhD ’10, said despite losing the vote, he’s happy with how the unionization campaign was run.\n“I think we ran a very open campaign. We had tons of different events to mobilize and engage TAs and TFs at Queen’s,” he said. “We all feel really happy that we ran a straight-up campaign that was transparent. The kinds of friends and coalitions that were formed during the campaign will outlive TAFA. We are pleased with the level of autonomy that PSAC gave to the graduate student body. The union campaign was internally driven.”\nThompson said he still thinks there is a place for a TA and TF union at Queen’s.\n“I feel like a union would be an important contribution to protect TAs and TFs as workers on campus,” he said. “It is frustrating for us to have lost so closely.”\n“I think that there is an interest for graduate students to have representation on campus. The question will be whether or not there are enough dedicated people pushing for a union. Nothing has been decided yet.”\nThompson said the strike at York wasn’t a decisive factor in the vote for unionization at Queen’s. TAs, graduate assistants, and contract faculty have been on strike at York since Nov. 6 2008.\n“It’s important to remember that the strike at York involves sessional staff,” he said. “It’s quite a different battle than what TAs and TFs were fighting for at Queen’s: not permanent positions but protection in current positions.\n“While we’re supportive of the York strikers, at York there is a different union body representing different union interests. The other big difference is between a striking union and union trying to organize. Problems that necessitate a strike do not exist here.”\nSociety of Graduate and Professional Students (SGPS) President Jeff Welsh, PhD ’09, said the result of the vote was disappointing.\n“I received a number of e-mails from SGPS members who voted against unionization. Based on the questions and comments, most of them were poorly informed,” he said.\nWelsh said some students in the natural and applied sciences were nervous about the impact unionization might have on their research assistantships. RAs were not included in the unionization drive.\n“I feel that if more people had more specific information, the result would have been different.\n“It wasn’t a conclusive vote one way or another in my opinion,” he said. “Unless the University moves fairly quickly to address these issues, I could imagine a union drive in the future. The issues haven’t gone away. The vote was very close.”\nIn order to put TA and TF unionization to a vote at Queen’s, 40 per cent of the bargaining unit needed to sign union cards. After this, a review by the Ontario Labour Relations Board decided whether or not unionization could be put to a vote.\nWelsh said more people signed union cards than turned out to vote for unionization.\n“Apparently over 800 people signed union cards. Less than half of those who signed cards bothered to vote.”\nWelsh said one possible reason for this was the short window of time given to vote.\n“There was only one station on one day [for voting.] There are a lot of graduate students who aren’t on campus every day.”",

      "content": "On Tuesday evening, to kick off Queen’s 175th speaker series, IBM data analytics VP Paul Zikopoulos gave an in-depth presentation at Goodes Hall on the often-misunderstood use of ‘big data’.Big data, he explained to the crowd, consists of large data sets that can be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations in human interactions and behaviour.Zikopoulos, who is considered a global expert in data and analytical technology, described to an intimate crowd why big data is important to us and how data analytics have the potential to solve a myriad of social issues.Topics he touched on included  sustainable healthcare costs and governmental bureaucratic inefficiencies — from a “360-degree perspective”. As well, businesses can observe consumer behaviour and demographics based on data retrieved from mobile phones and social media apps.Big data is a combination of three factors. The first, the cloud, provides the infrastructure for big data to be compiled.The second factor is social media. Everyone, he said, uses some form of it and it serves as a “pulse of individuality” for consumers. From analyzing social media activity, we know where younger generations are spending their time, what they’re consuming and for how long.Mobile phones are the third factor, as the apps we use every day are the source of most of the analytical data collected by businesses today.Zikopoulos further explained emerging trends in businesses, as well as what makes a company successful in the 21st century — and its all to do with analytical transformation, as he terms it.Successful companies are hyper-personalizing their services and products based on the behavioural data of consumers, he said, and meeting needs in an unprecedentedly-tailored way.“Everyone has the opportunity to disrupt almost anything with data,” he said. “Every company will be a data company in the future. Other companies will be disrupted, become data companies or cease to exist.”Apps such as Pokemon Go, Snapchat, or Vine, to him, are prevalent collectors of observable data.“If you don’t pay for a service, you are the product being sold,” he told the crowd. “We are collecting data.

As well, businesses can observe consumer behaviour and demographics based on data retrieved from mobile phones and social media apps.</p><p>Big data is a combination of three factors. The first, the cloud, provides the infrastructure for big data to be compiled.</p><p>The second factor is social media. Everyone, he said, uses some form of it and it serves as a “pulse of individuality” for consumers. From analyzing social media activity, we know where younger generations are spending their time, what they’re consuming and for how long.</p><p>Mobile phones are the third factor, as the apps we use every day are the source of most of the analytical data collected by businesses today.</p><p>Zikopoulos further explained emerging trends in businesses, as well as what makes a company successful in the 21st century — and its all to do with analytical transformation, as he terms it.</p><p>Successful companies are hyper-personalizing their services and products based on the behavioural data of consumers, he said, and meeting needs in an unprecedentedly-tailored way.</p><p>“Everyone has the opportunity to disrupt almost anything with data,” he said. “Every company will be a data company in the future. Other companies will be disrupted, become data companies or cease to exist.”</p><p>Apps such as Pokemon Go, Snapchat, or Vine, to him, are prevalent collectors of observable data.</p><p>“If you don’t pay for a service, you are the product being sold,” he told the crowd. “We are collecting data.

With a local focus, the group’s advocacy is implemented largely through educational programs and interactive events focused on environmental conservation. According to the event description, the Foundation for Environmental Stewardship (FES) is an accredited “youth-led, youth-serving sustainable development” UN organization, which aims to “create a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable future by empowering youth.”Called the Queen’s University United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Youth Training Seminar, the Nov. 16 event will welcome over 200 secondary and post-secondary students from Queen’s and Kingston to Ellis Hall for sustainability training.The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Youth Training program was devised as a part of Canada 150 celebrations. The program’s stop at Queen’s is one of 50 training sessions being held in colleges and universities across the country this year.According to SCB Co-President Ashley Concessio, the SDGs Youth Training Seminar will “mobilize youth and teach them the skills they need to become the leaders of a sustainable tomorrow.” During the seminar, a United Nations speaker will address students on how best to influence policy, practice advocacy and promote sustainability developments.“This youth training seminar not only provides youth with a certificate in sustainability but also supports local clubs like our own in implementing our own projects that will benefit the Queen’s and Kingston community,” Concessio wrote in an email to The Journal.Not only will this event offer attendees the opportunity to connect with UN officials and policymakers, but they also have the chance to meet with public policy activists who have been on the forefront of the sustainable development movement around the globe. According to SCB Vice-President Zoe Walters, the development goals are designed to essentially be a “catch-all for turning the world.”“The UN has these in place, basically, to save the world,” Walters told The Journal. “[The seminar] is meant to be engaging and meant to feel worthwhile. We want people to come out of it really feeling like they [are] trained.”For participating in the seminar, attendees will receive a certificate in sustainability training from the Foundation of Environmental Stewardship. Walters said the training will encourage students to support SCB’s local sustainability efforts, which will in turn have a direct and immediate impact on the Kingston and Queen’s community.“Queen’s has so many clubs that hold so much value, but a lot of the work is done far away,” she said. “We want to instill a feeling of value for the environment they want to conserve, because as we know, half of conservation is conserving it in your own backyard.”While tickets were originally priced at $250, many partners and sponsors of the FES made contributions to subsidize the tickets. Students can now purchase tickets online for only $25.",

Although we value freedom of expression, we found that some of Dr. Mercier’s comments were grossly insensitive to Jewish students on campus.” Hillel President Ira Goldstein, ArtSci ’07, said he was “taken aback” by the comparison.\n“I understand her anger,” Goldstein told the Journal. “There’s emotions running high right now and her feelings are shared by so many people. Everyone’s condemning what happened on Saturday night, [but] she could have gotten her point across in a much more responsible manner.\n“I understand she wanted to draw a parallel, but that parallel offends us as Jews and Queen’s students in general because ... there are students on campus whose grandparents were involved in the Holocaust.” Goldstein said that he and Hillel believe Mercier should apologize for her remarks.\nIn an interview with the Journal, Mercier said she regrets that her statement caused offense, but does not intend to apologize.\n“It’s important not to interpret me as saying the events on Aberdeen Street are the same as the Holocaust,” Mercier said. “Who were the Hitler youth? They were just nice kids that stopped thinking, and it’s very dangerous to stop thinking because look at where it can lead. [It’s] ceasing to be rational. It may seem harmless, but we know we have horrible incidents of what can happen when people stop being rational.” Mercier said she became aware that her letter had offended some students after a student dropped by her office. Since then, she has received several e-mails from students. She said some e-mails have asked her to resign, while others have been from students who would like to meet with her.\nLater in the Toronto Star, Mercier wrote that virtually all of those present on Aberdeen Street last weekend were “white, privileged middle-class kids.”\nThat comment has drawn the attention of AMS President Ethan Rabidoux.\n“Now we have comparisons to Hitler youth and we’re being typecast and stereotyped as white, middle-class students,” Rabidoux said, adding Queen’s students come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n“A lot of students are struggling their way through [financially], and a lot of students were not on Aberdeen,” he said.\nMercier said her characterization of “white, privileged, middle-class kids” was meant to apply only to those she observed on Aberdeen Street on Saturday night.\n“I was at the party for several hours, and I made a note of noting the ethnic variety of the kids at the party,” Mercier said. “I went there with the intent of noticing that and what the proportion of men to women was.”\nMercier said she made the characterization in reference to the Toronto Star and Kingston Whig-Standard’s decision to put a photo of a black partier on their front pages.\n“[The Aberdeen party] was overwhelmingly white, and the point about that is the unfairness of having this black kid be the poster boy for the drunken brawl,” Mercier said. “I think that’s reprehensible.” Mercier added that she does not think Queen’s students are universally white and middle-class, but does think they are all privileged.\n“I don’t think anybody at Queen’s can argue they’re lacking in privilege compared to other Canadians,” Mercier said. “They’re at one of the best research institutions in the country. You have to be worthy of the privilege.”\nMercier also told the Journal she believes there is an underlying psychology of “incredible self-entitlement” among students.\n“There’s this implicit mentality that because they contribute so much money to the city, it confers upon them certain freedoms that other residents of Kingston don’t have. The freedom to drink in public, the freedom to drink underage [and] the freedom to have parties that annoy their neighbours,” Mercier said.\nRabidoux said he is concerned that Mercier chose to enclose her position at the University with the letter.\n“Every individual has the right to state their own opinion, but she attached the Queen’s name to that letter, therefore people will assume when reading it it’s a reflection of Queen’s attitude to this situation,” Rabidoux said.\n“The administration has not been proactive in standing up for students. Now they absolutely have to get out there and challenge these accusations.\n“Students are saying to me, ‘If faculty are saying this, then it’s pretty obvious [we can’t] expect the administration to defend us to the city council and media when they’re not defending us to their own staff.’ I don’t believe for a second that [letter] reflects what the vast majority of faculty think.”\n“If they’re going to treat it as an isolated incident and let it slide, then the damage to the administration’s credibility with students will be incalculable,” Rabidoux added.\nUniversity spokesperson Therese Greenwood said Principal Karen Hitchcock had no specific comment about Mercier’s letter.\n“The Principal feels like she’s made her own opinion known through her statement and she’s interested in what other people have to say,” Greenwood said, adding the “other people” include community members, students and faculty.\nRabidoux said he believes Mercier’s comments were offensive and “are not helping anything.”\n“It’s getting to the point where absolute hysteria is replacing reason,” he said. “This is a complicated issue and what we need is for everyone to take a deep breath and we’ll decide what to do.” Mercier said she was moved to write the letter out of her commitment to students.\n“It’s not all and only Queen’s students who are like this,” she said. “You expect better of Queen’s students. I’m very dedicated to my students and I’ll be damned if I stand by ... I consider myself first and foremost a teacher, and I consider it my duty to scold when I think scolding is appropriate.\n“My students will attest—I think almost universally—I’m a very devoted teacher and there’s something parental about being a teacher and I was hoping my students would listen to me.”",

More’s “Smithyman saga” novels, a military-historical fiction series set in the 18th century, follow the settler-to-squire life and loves of Billy Smithyman, a feisty Irishman who winds up being knighted for fighting the French, marries a Mohawk healer, and earns a Mohawk warrior’s name. \nHistory novelist David More\nMore’s writing for newspapers and technical journals had been widely published, but he started his first book at the urging of his wife, Donna, who thought it might be a good idea if he turned his hand to something other than building another boat. More, a history buff and mad keen sailor, wrote his first book, The Eastern Door, while he was working full-time as the medical laboratory manager at Kingston General Hospital. He spent his evenings in the book-crammed basement office of his historic Portsmouth Village house, tapping away on his computer and reading great piles of reference materials from the Stauffer Library.\nEven though he knew exactly the story he wanted to tell, the first book took him six years to complete. Half of that time he was researching and the other half he was writing. He stuck with it. He knew a little about sticking with things. More started his undergraduate degree at McGill in 1967 and finished it at Waterloo in 1991, 25 long years after his freshman days. He did two-thirds of his degree by correspondence, working evenings while he worked full-time days. Royce McGillivray, Arts’59, a history professor at U of W, gave More a rare A+.

The next Loyalist instalment in the Smithyman Saga, entitled The King’s Salt, is timed for the War of 1812 Bicentennial celebrations.\n“Self-publishing gives you a lot of control over everything from the art on the cover, to the graphics and maps, to the marketing of your book,” says David, “and you don’t give up your copyright.

Cara Babineau, ArtSci ’12, one of the organizers for the banquet, said the banquet is a metaphor.\n“People go for the experience. People come in and they’re assigned to a different economic class, parts of the world that have more or less,” she said. “It’s a demonstration at the beginning of the dinner part of the evening.

The last class might have to sit on the floor and they might not get water, things like that.

They’re also interested in food security. One of the speakers will be speaking about how everything is affected and another will be talking just about women or climate change specifically.”\nThe evening’s collection of speakers will include the Youth and Campus Outreach Officer of Oxfam Toronto Taryn Diamond.\n“She’s a great speaker and can connect with students really well,” Babineau said. “She can really show people of our age group how we can do things to really change what affects us and the world.” Babineau said the conference differs a lot from its structure in previous years.\n“Before we would have workshops and things during the day with just the dinner and conference in the evening,” she said, adding that this year’s combination of a dinner workshop will enable more people to become involved with all aspects of the events at once.\nThe decision to change this year’s event name to the ‘Hunger Banquet’ was to present the issue of chronic hunger as the focal point.\n“The Hunger Banquet is actually something that Oxfam Canada has,” Babineau said, “It was originally called Hungry4Change because it was about recognizing people that are hungry around the world.

      "content": "Globe and Mail writer-editor Gordon Pitts has struck \r\nliterary gold with his latest book, Stampede!\nGlobe and Mail writer-editor Gordon Pitts has struck \r\nliterary gold with his latest book, Stampede!\nWhen you’re employed as a business reporter nowadays, you have to be on guard when meeting friends for lunch, showing up at family reunions, or simply leaving the house in the morning. “Everyone asks, ‘What do you think is going to happen to the economy?” laughs Gordon Pitts, Arts’69, Ed’70, senior editor and writer at The Globe and Mail’s Report on Business.\nGordon, who majored in history during his undergrad years at Queen’s and then earned his education degree, never planned on a journalism career; he fell into one after a brief teaching stint. After studying journalism at Carleton and interning at The Ottawa Citizen, with journalist Gordon Legge, he became fascinated with business journalism.\n“This was in the late 1970s, during the heyday of OPEC, rising oil prices, inflation, and interest rates of 20 per cent. The business story moved off the business pages to the front page.”\nAs well, Gordon says the democratization of investing encouraged people to pick up the business section of the newspaper and learn more about what they were doing with their money. This made it all the more challenging to report on it. “In the ‘80s and ‘90s, more people owned stocks and were buying mutual funds. People became very interested in their stocks.”\nGordon hit the world of business journalism just as the lines between business, economic and political reporting were fading. “The old Report on Business covered business news in a drab, but serviceable style, but that age of journalism went. Now there was a much wider audience and these stories became the huge stories of our era – inflation, depression, recession and energy ups and downs.”\nGordon gives credit to The Establishment writer Peter C. Newman for personalizing business journalism with his stories about Canadian business elite. Ironically, Gordon beat out Newman for the 2009 National Business Book Award this year with his latest effort, Stampede! The Rise of the West and Canada’s New Power Elite (Key Porter). Other nominees for the $20,000 prize included heavyweights Margaret Atwood and the late Ted Rogers.\nStampede! makes some bold predictions about the future of Canada. Says Gordon, “When I started writing the book, oil was $60-$70 a barrel, high by historical standards. Then the oil price took off to $140 a barrel, and I figured the book would be a phenomenal success. I put it to bed in August, and then the price started dropping. Now oil is where it was when I started. I had to just figure, well, this is a long-term book.”\nEven though he maintains Stampede! is a national book (“I wanted to tell the story of Canada in 2008-2009,” he explains), Gordon knows people in central Canada might not want to hear his message.\n“It’s a bit of a harder sell in Ontario and Quebec, because people there are in denial. It’s a tough message. I think Alberta embraces it a bit more, but not all of it, because there’s a lot of criticism of the get-rich-quick short-termism of Albertans. The people of Saskatchewan must be happy about it because they have the strongest economy right now.”\nStampede! is Gordon Pitts’ fifth book.

After studying journalism at Carleton and interning at <em>The Ottawa Citizen</em>, with journalist Gordon Legge, he became fascinated with business journalism.</p>\n<p>“This was in the late 1970s, during the heyday of OPEC, rising oil prices, inflation, and interest rates of 20 per cent. The business story moved off the business pages to the front page.”</p>\n<p>As well, Gordon says the democratization of investing encouraged people to pick up the business section of the newspaper and learn more about what they were doing with their money. This made it all the more challenging to report on it. “In the ‘80s and ‘90s, more people owned stocks and were buying mutual funds. People became very interested in their stocks.”</p>\n<p>Gordon hit the world of business journalism just as the lines between business, economic and political reporting were fading. “The old Report on Business covered business news in a drab, but serviceable style, but that age of journalism went. Now there was a much wider audience and these stories became the huge stories of our era – inflation, depression, recession and energy ups and downs.”</p>\n<p>Gordon gives credit to <em>The Establishment</em> writer Peter C. Newman for personalizing business journalism with his stories about Canadian business elite. Ironically, Gordon beat out Newman for the 2009 National Business Book Award this year with his latest effort, <em>Stampede!</em> The Rise of the West and Canada’s New Power Elite (Key Porter). Other nominees for the $20,000 prize included heavyweights Margaret Atwood and the late Ted Rogers.</p>\n<p><em>Stampede!</em> makes some bold predictions about the future of Canada. Says Gordon, “When I started writing the book, oil was $60-$70 a barrel, high by historical standards. Then the oil price took off to $140 a barrel, and I figured the book would be a phenomenal success. I put it to bed in August, and then the price started dropping. Now oil is where it was when I started. I had to just figure, well, this is a long-term book.”</p>\n<p>Even though he maintains <em>Stampede!</em> is a national book (“I wanted to tell the story of Canada in 2008-2009,” he explains), Gordon knows people in central Canada might not want to hear his message.</p>\n<p>“It’s a bit of a harder sell in Ontario and Quebec, because people there are in denial. It’s a tough message. I think Alberta embraces it a bit more, but not all of it, because there’s a lot of criticism of the get-rich-quick short-termism of Albertans. The people of Saskatchewan must be happy about it because they have the strongest economy right now.”</p>\n<p><em>Stampede!</em> is Gordon Pitts’ fifth book. While a Press Fellow at Cambridge University in 1989, he started his first, <em>Storming the Fortress: How Canadian Business Can Conquer Europe</em> in 1992. It was nominated for the same award <em>Stampede!</em> has now won. His next three books – <em>In the Blood: Battles to Succeed In Canada’s Family Businesses</em> (2000), <em>Kings of Convergence: The Fight for Control of Canada’s Media </em>(2002), and <em>The Codfathers: Lessons from the Atlantic Business Elite</em> (2005) – all were finalists as well.
